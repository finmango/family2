# Financial Planning Calculator Assumptions

This document outlines the key assumptions and limitations of the Family Financial Planning Calculator. Understanding these assumptions is crucial for interpreting the results accurately.

## General Assumptions

1. **Time Horizon:** The calculator projects financials for a 15-year period.
2. **Inflation:** The calculator accounts for inflation through user-input growth rates for salaries, expenses, and childcare costs. All projected values are in nominal terms (not adjusted for inflation).
3. **Tax Simplification:** Tax calculations are simplified and do not account for tax brackets, deductions, or credits.

## Income Assumptions

1. **Salary Growth:** Assumes a constant annual salary growth rate for both partners, which implicitly includes both inflation and real wage growth.
2. **Workforce Leave:** Assumes immediate return to the original salary after a leave period, which is then adjusted for growth in subsequent years.

## Expense Assumptions

1. **Childcare Costs:** 
   - Baseline costs are pre-set and increase annually based on projected inflation.
   - Additional costs entered by the user are applied for up to 5 years and increase at a user-specified rate.
2. **Living Expenses:** Assumes a constant growth rate for all basic living expenses, including healthcare, which accounts for both inflation and potential real cost increases.

## Retirement Savings Assumptions

1. **Contribution Rates:** Assumes constant contribution rates throughout the 15-year period.
2. **Employer Match:** Assumes a constant employer match rate.
3. **Investment Returns:** Assumes a conservative 8% annual return on retirement savings, which is typically considered to be a nominal return (including inflation).

## Child-Related Assumptions

1. **Number of Children:** The calculator assumes one child for families with children.
2. **Child Costs:** Uses USDA estimates for the annual cost of raising a child, with built-in annual increases to account for inflation and other factors.

## Limitations

1. **Simplified Projections:** This tool provides simplified projections and should not be considered a comprehensive financial plan.
2. **No Investment Choices:** The calculator doesn't account for different investment strategies or risk profiles.
3. **No Debt Considerations:** The calculator does not factor in debt repayment or accumulation.
4. **Static Lifestyle:** The model assumes relatively static lifestyle choices and doesn't account for major life changes beyond the initial inputs.
